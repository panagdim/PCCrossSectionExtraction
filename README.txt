About

The application was designed and completed back in early 2015. The application can be used to extract tree cross 
sections mainly for diameter at breast height (DBH) [1.27-1.33] from photogrammetric and LiDAR point clouds.

However, it can also be used to extract cross-sections at different heights along the trunk since the height condition can be changed in the source code (Form1.cs) to fit your requirements.

- It is pretty easy to use; run the application and follow the steps.
- Before you upload your file, please ensure that (z-> height) is normalized.
  To normalize your point cloud, you can use several software, i.e., LasTools, CloudCompare, etc.
- For the moment, the application supports three different input file formats (txt,csv and xyz).
- Before closing the application, click the save button to export your result.
- Of course, the processing time depends on your file size. From my personal experience, it can handle relatively large files.
