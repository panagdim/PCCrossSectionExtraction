About

This application is particularly designed for the extraction of tree trunk cross 
sections mainly at diameter at breast height (DBH) [1.27-1.33] from photogrammetric and LiDAR point clouds.

It can also be used for extraction of cross sections in different heights along the trunk, since the height condition can be changed in the source code (Form1.cs) to fit your requirements.

- It is quite easy to use, simply run the application and follow the steps.
- Before you upload your file please make sure that (z-> height) is normalized.
  To normalize your point cloud you can use several software, i.e., LasTools, CloudCompare, etc.
- For the moment the application supports three different types of input file formats (txt,csv and xyz).
- Before closing the application, make sure to click the save button to export your result.
- Of course the processing time depends on how big your file is. From my experience it can handle quite large files.
